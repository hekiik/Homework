<h2>Kuna küsitud oli teksti, siis ma pastan ühe lõigu oma novellist:</h2>
<p>It was a gloomy day. The force-field forming a dark grey sky above the citizens heads. <br>It no longer rained or snowed in the city and it was never cold.
<br>
Mark was standing at the edge of his window, a lit cigarette against his lips as he inhaled the soothing smog. <br>The artificial breeze cooling his face. The streets too far away for him to see what was going on he was gazing at the dark grey sky. <br>The silence of the evening broken by the occasional passing hovcar.
<br>
<br>
He inhaled one last time as he flicked the bud downwards. <br>Watching the trail of smoke carried away by a gentle breeze. <br>The soft glow of the generators and the bright neon advertisements lighting the otherwise dreary city.
<br>
<br>
The TV was running and all the news stations were talking about the same incident.
<br>
<br>
"...unable to get a witness report as the police had already arrived on the scene taking the witnesses into protective custody. <br>The main suspect was already transported off the scene. The scene of the crime was sealed off and they are now looking for the footage of the security cameras. <br>Gavenport Industries refused to comment on the incident. Their CEO still claims that it is impossible for their robots to kill humans and..."
<br>
<br>
"Hey ZED, what do you think?" <br>Mark was now leaning his head backwards outside of the window, still looking at the skydome.
<br>
<br>
"I think it would be easier to frame a robot rather than reprogramming their inhibitor chip, Sir."
<br>
<br>
Mark let out a deep sigh. <br>"These bastards would do anything to get the robots off the streets. Even going as far as murder. And soon after this incident a lot of people are going to hop on that bandwagon."
<br>
<br>
Mark raised his head upright and looked at ZED. His custom parts and colour displacement giving him a poor look. <br><i>"I'll fix that...eventually...bah, he doesn't mind so its fine like this. Chromic paint is expensive." </i>
